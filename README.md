rust-cc
-------

rust-cc will be a C compiler written in Rust.

Planned:

 - primitive types (int, char)
 - pointers
 - arrays
 - function definitions

Not planned:

 - malloc, free
 - header files
 - standard library support

rust-cc is a cross between learning project and proof of concept. Do not use
this program for C development.


why did you make this?
----------------------

Because I wanted to write a C compiler before dying.
